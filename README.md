## Communication
I have found that communication is at the core of all relationships, be they friendly, professional or otherwise and so I find it apt to start there. Frankly, my philosophy on communication can be summed up in six words:

**“Brevity is the soul of wit.”**

I pride myself on saying what I mean and meaning what I say, and as such I aim to convey my point as quickly and concisely as possible. Verbosity has it's place, but I rarely find that place to be the workplace. 

### Getting in Touch
#### Means (Prioritized by Response Time)
1. **Text/Page** *(Immediate)*

  In my world, a work text, or worse a page, means there is something going horribly wrong and I need to take action immediately lest the whole world implode. This form of communication is to be used sparingly and with great gravitas.
  
2. **Slack (DM)** *(Near-Term)*

  If you've got an ask for me or want to run something by me that needs attention in the next few days, feel free to shoot me a DM. Try to keep the message to a few sentences that expound on *what* you need and *when* you need it. I'll do my best to acknowledge your message in a timely manner and let you know when I'll follow up.
  
3. **Email** *(Long-Term)*

  Anything that gets sent to my email *will* get addressed, it's just a matter of when. I use my inbox as a secondary **TODO** list and rarely let messages linger longer than a week. That said, if you haven't received a response in a week, feel free to give me a nudge. 

### Social Media
I have found that social media does not serve me and as a result I have removed the temptation to spend time wandering those networks by deleting the vast majority my social accounts. That said, I have maintained a few which I have either found useful or necessary (or so I'm told).
